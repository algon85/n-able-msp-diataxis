# How-To Guides

This section contains **task-focused, step-by-step guides** for N-able products. Unlike tutorials, these how-tos are designed to solve specific problems or accomplish discrete tasks rather than teach full workflows from start to finish.

## Audience
These guides are intended for:
- Helpdesk and NOC professionals
- MSP staff performing operational tasks
- Technicians who need actionable instructions quickly

## Scope
The how-tos in this directory cover:
- Common operational problems
- Step-by-step solutions
- Best practices for day-to-day tasks

They do **not** provide conceptual explanations or complete workflows — for background concepts, see the [Explanations](../explanations/) section, and for terminology or platform facts, see the [Reference](../reference/) section.

## How to Use These How-Tos
- Choose the product folder relevant to your work (e.g., `n-central`, `take-control`, `mail-assure`)  
- Open the how-to file corresponding to the task you need to complete  
- Follow the steps sequentially; consult explanations or reference material as needed
