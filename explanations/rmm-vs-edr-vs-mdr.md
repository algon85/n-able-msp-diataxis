# RMM vs EDR vs MDR

**Status:** Draft  
**Diátaxis Type:** Explanation  
**Product/Scope:** Overview of monitoring and security tools useful for MSP operations

## Purpose
This explanation introduces the key distinctions between **RMM (Remote Monitoring & Management)**, **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)**, and **MDR (Managed Detection & Response)**. The goal is to clarify their purposes, how they overlap, and when each is used in a managed services context.

## Scope
Covers:
- Primary function of each tool  
- Typical use cases 
- Integration considerations  
- How they complement one another  

## Key Concepts

- **RMM (Remote Monitoring & Management):** Tools for monitoring endpoint health, deploying updates, running scripts, and alerting on failures. Typically agent-based and focused on IT operations.  

- **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response):** Focuses on detecting, investigating, and responding to security threats on endpoints. Often includes threat analytics, malware detection, and forensic capabilities.  

- **MDR (Managed Detection & Response):** A service that combines EDR technology with security expertise to proactively monitor, detect, and respond to threats on behalf of the MSP. Provides 24/7 security operations.
