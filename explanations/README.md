# Explanations

This section contains **conceptual and contextual documentation** for N-able products. Explanations help readers understand the “why” behind workflows, platform differences, and core concepts.

Unlike tutorials or how-tos, these documents **focus on understanding** rather than doing.

## Audience
These explanations are intended for:
- Helpdesk and NOC Professionals
- MSP staff learning platform concepts and architecture
- Technicians who want a deeper understanding of workflows

## Scope
This section covers:
- Conceptual comparisons between platforms
- How products fit into an MSP stack
- Key terms, principles, and operational concepts

It does **not** provide step-by-step task guidance — for that, see the [Tutorials](../tutorials/) and [How-To](../how-to/) sections.

## How to Use These Explanations
- Review explanations relevant to the platform or concept you are learning  
- Use these materials to support your understanding while following tutorials or how-tos  
- Link back to reference materials as needed for definitions or codes
