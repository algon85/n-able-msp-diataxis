## Comparison Overview

Both products are part of the N-able remote monitoring and management suite, but they address different MSP needs:

| Category | N-sight RMM | N-central RMM |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Primary focus | Simple, cloud‑first RMM for small to mid‑sized MSPs | Full‑featured, scalable RMM for larger or enterprise MSPs |
| Deployment | SaaS only, accessible via web | Cloud or self‑hosted options |
| Complexity | Lower — quick onboarding and less configuration | Higher — deeper customization and policy control |
| Automation | Standard, check‑based monitoring | Advanced policy‑based automation |
| Ideal for | MSPs needing rapid setup and straightforward workflows | MSPs needing deep control and scale |

## Key Differences

### Target Audience
- **N-sight** is designed for MSPs that prioritize ease of use and rapid deployment.  
- **N-central** targets MSPs with larger environments and higher customization requirements.

### Deployment and Management
N-sight is cloud‑only and centrally managed, while N-central can be cloud‑hosted or on‑premises, offering deeper control over infrastructure and policies.

### Feature Breadth
N-central includes advanced automation policies, role‑based access, and extensive customization options. N-sight focuses on core RMM features with simpler configuration.

## When to Choose Which
- Choose **N-sight** if speed of onboarding and ease of use are priorities.  
- Choose **N-central** when you need robust automation, deep configuration, and scalability.
