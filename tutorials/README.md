# Tutorials

This section contains **learning-oriented, end-to-end tutorials** for N-able products. Unlike how-tos, tutorials are designed to teach complete workflows from start to finish, guiding readers through real-world scenarios.

## Audience
These tutorials are intended for:
- Helpdesk and NOC Professionals
- MSP staff learning to manage endpoints and services
- Technicians new to each platform

## Scope
The tutorials in this directory cover:
- Full workflows for client onboarding, agent deployment, monitoring, and core operations
- Platform setup and initial configuration
- Step-by-step exercises to practice key operations

They do **not** cover every advanced feature, integration, or scripting — for conceptual background see the [Explanations](../explanations/) section, and for definitions and facts see the [Reference](../reference/) section.

## How to Use These Tutorials
- Choose the product folder relevant to your work (e.g., `n-central`, `n-sight`, `cove-data-protection`, `passportal`)  
- Open the tutorial file corresponding to the workflow you want to learn  
- Follow the steps sequentially; refer to explanations or reference material as needed
